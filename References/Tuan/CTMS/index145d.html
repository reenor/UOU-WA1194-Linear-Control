      <p>Simulink contains a large number of blocks from which models can be build. These blocks are arranged in <b>Block Libraries</b> which are accessed in the main Simulink window shown below
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/mainwin.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>Each icon in the main Simulink window can be double clicked to bring up the corresponding block library. Blocks in each library
         can then be dragged into a model window to build a model.
      </p>
      <h2>Commonly Used Blocks<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p><b>Commonly Used Blocks</b> are used to list a lot of blocks which are usually used. Double-click on the <b>Commonly Used Blocks</b> icon in the main Simulink windows to bring up the Commonly Used window.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/comusedwin.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p><b>Bus Creator</b></p>
      <p>The Bus Creator block combines a set of signals into a bus.</p>
      <p><b>Bus Selector</b></p>
      <p>The Bus Selector block outputs a specified subset of the elements of the bus at its input. The block can output the specified
         elements as separate signals or as a new bus.
      </p>
      <p><b>Constant</b></p>
      <p>The <b>Constant</b> block generates a real or complex constant value. The constant output value is displayed in the middle of the block, with
         a default value of 1.
      </p>
      <p>In order to examine these blocks, create a new model window (select <b>New</b> from the <b>File</b> menu in the Simulink window or hit Ctrl+N).
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/newmodel.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>To use this block, drag it from the Commonly Used Blocks window into your new model window.</p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/conmodel.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>To change the constant output value, double-click on the block in your model window to bring up the following dialog box.</p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/cdial.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>Change the constant value field from 1 to some other value, say, 5, and close the dialog box. Your model window will reflect
         the update by displaying a 5 in the middle of the constant block.
      </p>
      <p><b>Data Type Conversion</b></p>
      <p>The Data Type Conversion block converts an input signal of any Simulink data type to the data type you specify for the Output
         data type parameter. The input can be any real- or complex-valued signal.
      </p>
      <p><b>Demux</b>, <b>Mux</b></p>
      <p>The Mux (Multiplexer) block is used to combine two or more scalar signals into a single vector signal. Similarly, a Demux
         (Demultiplexer) block breaks a vector signal into scalar signal components. The number of vector components must be specified
         in each case. For an example of the use of a Mux block see the <a href="index0ab7.html?example=Suspension&amp;section=SimulinkModeling">Bus Suspension Modeling in Simulink</a> example.
      </p>
      <p><b>Discrete-Time Integrator</b></p>
      <p>This is the discrete time approximation of a continuous-time integrator. The approximation method can be specified as well
         as the initial condition and saturation limits.
      </p>
      <p><b>Gain</b></p>
      <p>The Gain block multiplies the input by a constant value (gain). The input and the gain can each be a scalar, vector, or matrix.</p>
      <p><b>Ground</b></p>
      <p>The Ground block connects to blocks whose input ports do not connect to other blocks.</p>
      <p><b>In1</b></p>
      <p>Inport blocks are the links from outside a system into the system.</p>
      <p><b>Integrator</b></p>
      <p>The output of the Integrator is the integral of the input. An initial condition can be specified, as well as saturation limits.
         This block is very useful for <a href="index5af4.html?example=Introduction&amp;section=SimulinkModeling">modeling systems in Simulink</a>.
      </p>
      <p><b>Logical Operator</b></p>
      <p>The Logical Operator block performs the specified logical operation on its inputs. An input value is TRUE (1) if it is nonzero
         and FALSE (0) if it is zero.
      </p>
      <p><b>Out1</b></p>
      <p>Outport blocks are the links from a system to a destination outside the system.</p>
      <p><b>Product</b></p>
      <p>By default, the <b>Product</b> block outputs the result of multiplying two inputs: two scalars, a scalar and a nonscalar, or two nonscalars that have the
         same dimensions.
      </p>
      <p><b>Relational Operator</b></p>
      <p>By default, the <b>Relational Operator</b> block compares two inputs using the <b>Relational operator</b> parameter that you specify. The first input corresponds to the top input port and the second input to the bottom input port.
      </p>
      <p><b>Saturation</b></p>
      <p>The Saturation block imposes upper and lower limits on an input signal.</p>
      <p><b>Scope</b></p>
      <p>The Scope block displays inputs signals with respect to simulation time.</p>
      <p><b>Subsystem</b></p>
      <p>A Subsystem block represents a subsystem of the system that contains it. The <b>Subsystem</b> block can represent a virtual subsystem or a nonvirtual subsystem.
      </p>
      <p><b>Sum</b></p>
      <p>The Sum block performs addition or subtraction on its inputs. This block can add or subtract scalar, vector, or matrix inputs.
         It can also collapse the elements of a signal.
      </p>
      <p><b>Switch</b></p>
      <p>The Switch block passes through the first input or the third input based on the value of the second input. The first and third
         inputs are called data inputs. The second input is called the control input.
      </p>
      <p><b>Terminator</b></p>
      <p>Use the Terminator block to cap blocks whose output ports do not connect to other blocks.</p>
      <p><b>Unit Delay</b></p>
      <p>The Unit Delay block holds and delays its input by the sample period you specify. This block is equivalent to the z-1 discrete-time
         operator.
      </p>
      <p><b>Vector Concatenate</b></p>
      <p>The Concatenate block concatenates the signals at its inputs to create an output signal whose elements reside in contiguous
         locations in memory.
      </p>
      <h2>Continuous<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p><b>Continuous Blocks</b> are elements of continuous-time dynamic systems. Double-click on the <b>Continuous</b> icon in the main Simulink window to bring up the Continuous window.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/continuous.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p><b>Derivative</b></p>
      <p>The output is equal to the derivative of the input.</p>
      <p><b>Integrator Limited</b></p>
      <p>The Integrator Limited block is identical to the Integrator block with the exception that the output of the block is limited
         based on the upper and lower saturation limits.
      </p>
      <p><b>Integrator, Second-Order</b>, <b>Integrator, Second-Order Limited</b></p>
      <p>The Second-Order Integrator block and the Second-Order Integrator Limited block solve the second-order initial value problem</p>
      <p><b>PID Controller</b></p>
      <p>The PID Controller block output is a weighted sum of the input signal, the integral of the input signal, and the derivative
         of the input signal. The weights are the proportional, integral, and derivative gain parameters.
      </p>
      <p><b>PID Controller (2DOF)</b></p>
      <p>The PID Controller (2DOF) block generates an output signal based on the difference between a reference signal and a measured
         system output.
      </p>
      <p><b>State Space</b></p>
      <p>A, B, C, and D matrices can be specified to create a LTI state space system. Inputs and outputs may be vector signals depending
         on the sizes of the matrices.
      </p>
      <p><b>Transfer Function</b></p>
      <p>Numerator and denominator polynomials can be specified to create a standard SISO LTI system transfer function.</p>
      <p><b>Transport Delay</b></p>
      <p>The Transport Delay block delays the input by a specified amount of time. You can use this block to simulate a time delay.
         The input to this block should be a continuous signal.
      </p>
      <p><b>Variable Time Delay</b>, <b>Variable Transport Delay</b></p>
      <p>The Variable Transport Delay and Variable Time Delay appear as two blocks in the Simulink block library. However, they are
         the same Simulink block with different settings of a Select delay type parameter. Use this parameter to specify the mode in
         which the block operates.
      </p>
      <p><b>Zero-Pole</b></p>
      <p>The Zero-Pole block models a system that you define with the zeros, poles, and gain of a Laplace-domain transfer function.
         This block can model single-input single output (SISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems.
      </p>
      <h2>Discontinuities<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p><b>Discontinuities Blocks</b> are elements of discontinuous-time dynamic systems. Most of these have special-purpose applications and will not be used
         in the tutorials. Only the most relevant Discontinuities blocks will be discussed here. Double-click on the Discontinuities
         icon in the main Simulink window to bring up the Discontinuities window.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/discontiwin.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p><b>Backlash</b></p>
      <p>The Backlash block implements a system in which a change in input causes an equal change in output. . However, when the input
         changes direction, an initial change in input has no effect on the output.
      </p>
      <p><b>Coulomb &amp; Viscous Friction</b></p>
      <p>The Coulomb and Viscous Friction block models Coulomb (static) and viscous (dynamic) friction. The block models a discontinuity
         at zero and a linear gain otherwise.
      </p>
      <p><b>Dead Zone</b></p>
      <p>The Dead Zone block generates zero output within a specified region, called its dead zone.</p>
      <p><b>Dead Zone Dynamic</b></p>
      <p>The Dead Zone Dynamic block dynamically bounds the range of the input signal, providing a region of zero output.</p>
      <p><b>Hit Crossing</b></p>
      <p>The Hit Crossing block detects when the input reaches the Hit crossing offset parameter value in the direction specified by
         the Hit crossing direction property.
      </p>
      <p><b>Quantizer</b></p>
      <p>The Quantizer block passes its input signal through a stair-step function so that many neighboring points on the input axis
         are mapped to one point on the output axis.
      </p>
      <p><b>Rate Limiter</b></p>
      <p>The Rate Limiter block limits the first derivative of the signal passing through it. The output changes no faster than the
         specified limit.
      </p>
      <p><b>Rate Limiter Dynamic</b></p>
      <p>The Rate Limiter Dynamic block limits the rising and falling rates of the signal.</p>
      <p><b>Relay</b></p>
      <p>The Relay block allows its output to switch between two specified values. When the relay is on, it remains on until the input
         drops below the value of the Switch off point parameter. When the relay is off, it remains off until the input exceeds the
         value of the Switch on point parameter. The block accepts one input and generates one output.
      </p>
      <p><b>Saturation Dynamic</b></p>
      <p>The Saturation Dynamic block bounds the range of an input signal to upper and lower saturation values.</p>
      <p><b>Wrap To Zero</b></p>
      <p>The Wrap To Zero block sets the output to zero when the input is above the Threshold value. However, the block outputs the
         input when the input is less than or equal to the Threshold.
      </p>
      <h2>Discrete<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p><b>Discrete Blocks</b> are elements of discrete time dynamic systems. Double-click on the <b>Discrete</b> icon in the main Simulink window to bring up the Discrete window.
      </p>

      <p><b>Delay</b></p>
      <p>The Delay block delays an input u according to the Delay length parameter, which you specify on the dialog box, or a delay
         length that a signal supplies to the d input port.
      </p>
      <p><b>Difference</b></p>
      <p>The Difference block outputs the current input value minus the previous input value.</p>
      <p><b>Discrete Derivative</b></p>

      <p><b>Discrete FIR Filter</b></p>
      <p>The Discrete FIR Filter block independently filters each channel of the input signal with the specified digital FIR filter.
         The block can implement static filters with fixed coefficients, as well as time-varying filters with coefficients that change
         over time.
      </p>
      <p><b>Discrete State-Space</b></p>
      <p>This is a discrete-time dynamic system in state-space form. A, B, C, and D matrices can be specified, as well as initial conditions.</p>
      <p><b>Discrete Transfer Fcn</b></p>
      <p>This is the standard form of a SISO LTI discrete time system. The transfer function polynomials are represented as coefficient
         vectors in terms of z.
      </p>
      <p><b>Discrete Zero-Pole</b></p>
      <p>A discrete-time transfer function can be represented as list of z-plane poles and zeros. The gain can also be specified.</p>
      <p><b>First-Order Hold</b></p>
      <p>The First-Order Hold block implements a first-order sample-and-hold that operates at the specified sampling interval. This
         block has little value in practical applications and is included primarily for academic purposes.
      </p>
      <p><b>Memory</b></p>
      <p>The Memory block holds and delays its input by one integration time step. This block accepts and outputs continuous signals.
         The block accepts one input and generates one output. Each signal can be scalar or vector.
      </p>
      <p><b>Tapped Delay</b></p>
      <p>The Tapped Delay block delays an input by the specified number of sample periods and outputs all the delayed versions. Use
         this block to discretize a signal in time or resample a signal at a different rate.
      </p>
      <p><b>Transfer Fcn First Order</b></p>
      <p>The Transfer Fcn First Order block implements a discrete-time first order transfer function of the input. The transfer function
         has a unity DC gain.
      </p>
      <p><b>Transfer Fcn Lead or Lag</b></p>
      <p>The Transfer Fcn Lead or Lag block implements a discrete-time lead or lag compensator of the input. The instantaneous gain
         of the compensator is one, and the DC gain is equal to (1-z)/(1-p), where z is the zero and p is the pole of the compensator.
      </p>
      <p><b>Transfer Fcn Real Zero</b></p>
      <p>The Transfer Fcn Real Zero block implements a discrete-time transfer function that has a real zero and effectively no pole.</p>
      <p><b>Zero-Order Hold</b></p>
      <p>The Zero-Order Hold block holds its input for the sample period you specify. The block accepts one input and generates one
         output. Each signal can be scalar or vector.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/sinkswin.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>Notice that all of the sink blocks have inputs and no outputs. Most have a single input.</p>
      <p><b>Display</b></p>
      <p>The Display Sink Block is a digital readout of a signal at the current simulation time.</p>
      <p><b>Scope</b></p>
      <p>The Scope Sink Block was described earlier. It is used to display a signal as a function of time.</p>

      <p>This is a special control block which is triggered to stop the current simulation when its input is non-zero.</p>
      <p><b>To File</b></p>
      <p>The To File Sink Block saves a signal to a .mat file in the same way that the From File Source Block reads from a file. The
         sampling time can be specified, but is not necessary.
      </p>
      <p><b>To Workspace</b></p>
      <p>The To Workspace Sink Block stores a signal in a specified workspace variable. Unlike the To File Sink Block, the time is

      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/source.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>Notice that all of the source blocks have a single output and no inputs. While parameters in each of these blocks in the library
         can be modified by double-clicking the block, it is best to not modify the blocks until they have been copied into a model
         window.
      </p>
      <p><b>Band-Limited White Noise</b></p>
      <p>The Band-Limited White Noise Source Block generates a random signal which changes at a specified sample period. The strength

      </p>
      <p><b>Chirp Signal</b></p>
      <p>The Chirp Signal Source Block generates a sinusoidal signal which scans over a range of frequencies. The initial and final

         each frequency scan.
      </p>
      <p><b>Clock</b></p>
      <p>The Clock Source Block generates a signal equal to the current time in the simulation. This is useful when the output of a
         simulation is exported to MATLAB but occurs at uneven time steps. The clock's output reflects the times at which the other
         signals outputs occur.
      </p>
      <p><b>Counter Free-Running</b></p>
      <p>The Counter Free-Running block counts up until reaching the maximum value,</p>
      <p><img class="inline_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Blocklib_eq24981.html" alt="$2^{Nbits}-1$">, where Nbits is the number of bits. Then the counter overflows to zero and begins counting up again.
      </p>
      <p><b>Counter Limited</b></p>
      <p>The Counter Limited block counts up until the specified upper limit is reached. Then the counter wraps back to zero, and restarts

      <p><b>From File</b></p>
      <p>The From File Source Block outputs a signal taken from a specified .mat file. A matrix saved in MATLAB as a .mat file will
         become a signal where the first row of the matrix specifies the time values. This is similar to the Repeating Sequence Source
         Block.
      </p>
      <p><b>From Workspace</b></p>
      <p>The From Workspace Source Block is identical to the From File Source Block except the values are taken from a variable (or
         expression) in the MATLAB Workspace.
      </p>
      <p><b>Pulse Generator</b></p>
      <p>The Pulse Generator Source Block generates a pulse train of varying duty cycle. The signal switches between 0 and the specified
         value starting at a particular time. The Period, Duty Cycle, Amplitude, and Start Time can be specified.
      </p>
      <p><b>Ramp</b></p>
      <p>The Ramp Source Block generates a signal which is initially constant and begins to increase (or decrease) at a constant rate
         at a specified time. The slope, start time, and initial output can be specified.
      </p>
      <p><b>Random Number</b></p>
      <p>The Random Number Source Block generates a sequence of random numbers generated with the specified random number seed. Because
         of the seed, the same sequence can be applied to more than one simulation.
      </p>
      <p><b>Repeating Sequence</b></p>
      <p>An arbitrary set of points (t,y) can be specified. These points are entered as a vector specifying the time values, and a
         vector specifying the corresponding output values at those times. The output is linearly interpolated between the specified
         time values. At the last time value, the output immediately starts over, possibly with a discontinuous transition.
      </p>
      <p><b>Repeating Sequence Interpolated</b></p>
      <p>The Repeating Sequence Interpolated block outputs a discrete-time sequence and then repeats it.</p>
      <p><b>Repeating Sequence Stair</b></p>
      <p>The Repeating Sequence Stair block outputs and repeats a stair sequence that you specify with the Vector of output values
         parameter.
      </p>
      <p><b>Signal Generator</b></p>
      <p>The Signal Generator Source Block is a general-purpose source which encompasses some of the other blocks' functions. It generates
         periodic waveforms such as sine, square, and sawtooth waves as well as a random signal. Drag this block from the Sources window
         to your model window.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/sgmodel.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>By default, the Signal Generator generates a sine wave with an amplitude of 1 and a frequency of 1 Hz. To change this, double-click
         the Signal Generator in your model window to bring up the following dialog box.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/sgdia.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The Amplitude and Frequency can be changed in this dialog box, as well as the type of waveform. To change the waveform, click
         on the Waveform field to bring up a list of possible waveforms.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/sgwave.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The desired waveform can be selected from this list.</p>
      <p><b>Sine Wave</b></p>
      <p>The Sine Wave Source Block generates a sinusoidal signal. The Amplitude and Frequency can be specified, as well as the Phase
         (unlike the Signal Generator). There is a fourth parameter, the Sample Time, which can be used to force the Sine Wave Source
         to operate in discrete-time mode.
      </p>
      <p><b>Step</b></p>
      <p>As described earlier, the Step Source Block generates a step function. The initial and final values can be specified, as well
         as the step time.
      </p>
      <p><b>Uniform Random Number</b></p>
      <p>The Uniform Random Number block generates uniformly distributed random numbers over an interval that you specify.</p>

%
% The From Workspace Source Block is identical to the From File Source Block except the values are taken from a variable (or expression) in the MATLAB Workspace.
%
% *Pulse Generator*

%
% *Repeating Sequence*
%
% An arbitrary set of points (t,y) can be specified. These points are entered as a vector specifying the time values, and a vector specifying the corresponding output values at those times. The output is linearly interpolated between the specified time values. At the last time value, the output immediately starts over, possibly with a discontinuous transition.
%
% *Repeating Sequence Interpolated*
%
% The Repeating Sequence Interpolated block outputs a discrete-time sequence and then repeats it. 
%
% *Repeating Sequence Stair*
%
% The Repeating Sequence Stair block outputs and repeats a stair sequence that you specify with the Vector of output values parameter.
%
% *Signal Generator*
%
% The Signal Generator Source Block is a general-purpose source which
% encompasses some of the other blocks' functions. It generates periodic waveforms such as sine, square, and sawtooth waves as well as a random signal. Drag this block from the Sources window to your model window. 
% 
% <<Content/Extras/figures/sgmodel.png>>
%
% By default, the Signal Generator generates a sine wave with an amplitude
% of 1 and a frequency of 1 Hz. To change this, double-click the Signal Generator in your model window to bring up the following dialog box.
%
% <<Content/Extras/figures/sgdia.png>>
%
% The Amplitude and Frequency can be changed in this dialog box, as well as
% the type of waveform. To change the waveform, click on the Waveform field to bring up a list of possible waveforms. 
%
% <<Content/Extras/figures/sgwave.png>>
%
% The desired waveform can be selected from this list.
%
% *Sine Wave*
%
% The Sine Wave Source Block generates a sinusoidal signal. The Amplitude
% and Frequency can be specified, as well as the Phase (unlike the Signal
% Generator). There is a fourth parameter, the Sample Time, which can be used to force the Sine Wave Source to operate in discrete-time mode.
%
% *Step*
%
% As described earlier, the Step Source Block generates a step function.
% The initial and final values can be specified, as well as the step time.
%
% *Uniform Random Number*
%
% The Uniform Random Number block generates uniformly distributed random numbers over an interval that you specify.
