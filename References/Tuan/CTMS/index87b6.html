      <p>MATLAB is an interactive program for numerical computation and data visualization; it is used extensively by control engineers
         for analysis and design. There are many different toolboxes available which extend the basic functions of MATLAB into different
         application areas; in these tutorials, we will make extensive use of the Control Systems Toolbox. MATLAB is supported on Unix,
         Macintosh, and Windows environments; a student version of MATLAB is available for personal computers. For more information
         on MATLAB, please visit the MathWorks link at the top of the page.
      </p>
      <p>The idea behind these tutorials is that you can view them in one window while running MATLAB in another window. You should
         be able to re-do all of the plots and calculations in the tutorials by cutting and pasting text from the tutorials into MATLAB
         or an <tt>m-file</tt>.
      </p>
      <h2>Vectors<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>Let's start off by creating something simple, like a vector. Enter each element of the vector (separated by a space) between
         brackets, and set it equal to a variable. For example, to create the vector <b>a</b>, enter the following into the MATLAB command window (you can <b>Copy</b> and <b>Paste</b> from your browser into MATLAB to make it easy) and MATLAB should return the following:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">a = [1 2 3 4 5 6 9 8 7]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">a =
     1     2     3     4     5     6     9     8     7
</pre><p>Let's say you want to create a vector with elements between 0 and 20 evenly spaced in increments of two (this method is frequently
         used to create a time vector):
      </p><pre class="codeinput">t = 0:2:20
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">t =
     0     2     4     6     8    10    12    14    16    18    20
</pre><p>Manipulating vectors is almost as easy as creating them.  First, suppose you would like to add 2 to each of the elements in
         the vector <b>a</b>.  The equation for that looks like:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">b = a + 2
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">b =
     3     4     5     6     7     8    11    10     9
</pre><p>Now suppose, you would like to add two vectors together. If the two vectors are the same length, it is easy. Simply add the
         two as shown below:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">c = a + b
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">c =
     4     6     8    10    12    14    20    18    16
</pre><p>Subtraction of vectors of the same length works exactly the same way.</p>
      <h2>Functions<a name="12"></a></h2>
      <p>To make life easier, MATLAB includes many standard functions. Each function is a block of code that accomplishes a specific
         task. MATLAB contains all of the standard functions such as <tt>sin</tt>, <tt>cos</tt>, <tt>log</tt>, <tt>exp</tt>, <tt>sqrt</tt>, as well as many others. Commonly used constants such as <tt>pi</tt>, and <tt>i</tt> or <tt>j</tt> for the square root of -1, are also incorporated into MATLAB.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">sin(pi/4)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
    0.7071
</pre><p>To determine the usage of any function, type <tt>help [function name]</tt> at the MATLAB command window.
      </p>
      <p>MATLAB even allows you to write your own functions with the <b><tt>function</tt></b> command; follow the link to learn how to write your own functions and see a listing of the functions we created for this
         tutorial.
      </p>
      <h2>Plotting<a name="16"></a></h2>
      <p>It is also easy to create plots in MATLAB. Suppose you wanted to plot a sine wave as a function of time. First, make a time
         vector (the semicolon after each statement tells MATLAB we don't want to see all the values) and then compute the sin value
         at each time.  The commands after the <tt>plot</tt> function (<tt>title</tt>, <tt>xlabel</tt>, <tt>ylabel</tt>) will add annotations to the plot.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">t = 0:0.25:7;
y = sin(t);

plot(t,y)
title(<span class="string">'Sine Wave as a Function of Time'</span>)
xlabel(<span class="string">'Time (secs)'</span>)
ylabel(<span class="string">'Amplitude'</span>)
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Basics/html/Basics_Matlab_01.png" alt=""> <p>The plot contains approximately one period of a sine wave. Basic plotting is very easy in MATLAB, and the <tt>plot</tt> command has extensive add-on capabilities. I would recommend you visit the <b>plotting</b> page to learn more about it.
      </p>
      <h2>Polynomials as Vectors<a name="19"></a></h2>
      <p>In MATLAB, a polynomial is represented by a vector. To create a polynomial in MATLAB, simply enter each coefficient of the
         polynomial into the vector in descending order. For instance, let's say you have the following polynomial:
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(1)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Basics/html/Basics_Matlab_eq00365.png" alt="$$&#xA;s^4 + 3s^3 - 15s^2 - 2s +9&#xA;$$"></p>
      <p>To enter this into MATLAB, just enter it as a vector in the following manner:</p><pre class="codeinput">x = [1 3 -15 -2 9]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">x =
     1     3   -15    -2     9
</pre><p>MATLAB can interpret a vector of length n+1 as an nth order polynomial. Thus, if your polynomial is missing any coefficients,
         you must enter zeros in the appropriate place in the vector. For example,
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(2)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Basics/html/Basics_Matlab_eq75144.png" alt="$$&#xA;s^4 + 1&#xA;$$"></p>
      <p>would be represented in MATLAB as:</p><pre class="codeinput">y = [1 0 0 0 1]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">y =
     1     0     0     0     1
</pre><p>You can find the value of a polynomial using the <tt>polyval</tt> function.  For example, to find the value of the above polynomial at <tt>s = 2</tt>,
      </p><pre class="codeinput">z = polyval([1 0 0 0 1],2)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">z =
    17
</pre><p>You can also extract the roots of a polynomial.  This is useful when you have a high-order polynomial such as</p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(3)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Basics/html/Basics_Matlab_eq40604.png" alt="$$&#xA;s^4 + 3s^3 - 15s^2 - 2s + 9&#xA;$$"></p>
      <p>Finding the roots would be as easy as entering the following command:</p><pre class="codeinput">roots([1 3 -15 -2 9])
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
   -5.5745
    2.5836
   -0.7951
    0.7860
</pre><p>Let's say you want to multiply two polynomials together. The product of two polynomials is found by taking the convolution
         of their coefficients. MATLAB's function <tt>conv</tt> will do this for you.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">x = [1 2];
y = [1 4 8];
z = conv(x,y)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">z =
     1     6    16    16
</pre><p>Dividing two polynomials is just as easy.  The <tt>deconv</tt> function will return the remainder as well as the result.  Let's divide <tt>z</tt> by <tt>y</tt> and see if we get <tt>x</tt>.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">[xx, R] = deconv(z,y)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">xx =
     1     2
R =
     0     0     0     0
</pre><p>As you can see, this is just the polynomial/vector <tt>x</tt> from before. If <tt>y</tt> had not gone into <tt>z</tt> evenly, the remainder vector would have been something other than zero.
      </p>
      <h2>Polynomials Using the s Variable<a name="35"></a></h2>
      <p>Another way to represent a polynomial is to use the Laplace variable <tt>s</tt> within MATLAB.  This method is mainly used throughout these tutorials. Let's ignore the details of the Laplace domain for
         now and just represent polynomials with the <tt>s</tt> variable.  To define the variable, type the following into the MATLAB command window:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">s = tf(<span class="string">'s'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
s =
 
  s
 
Continuous-time transfer function.

</pre><p>Recall the polynomial given above:</p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(4)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Basics/html/Basics_Matlab_eq00365.png" alt="$$&#xA;s^4 + 3s^3 - 15s^2 - 2s +9&#xA;$$"></p>
      <p>To represent this in MATLAB, type the following into the MATLAB command window:</p><pre class="codeinput">polynomial = s^4 + 3*s^3 - 15*s^2 - 2*s + 9
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
polynomial =
 
  s^4 + 3 s^3 - 15 s^2 - 2 s + 9
 
Continuous-time transfer function.

</pre><p>Instead of using the <tt>roots</tt> function, we can use the <tt>zero</tt> function to find the roots of the polynomial.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">zero(polynomial)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
   -5.5745
    2.5836
   -0.7951
    0.7860
</pre><p>As you can see, the result is the same as above using the <tt>roots</tt> command and the coefficients of the polynomial.
      </p>
      <p>You can also multiply two polynomials together using the <tt>s</tt> variable. Let's redefine <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">x = s + 2;
y = s^2 + 4*s + 8;
z = x * y
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
z =
 
  s^3 + 6 s^2 + 16 s + 16
 
Continuous-time transfer function.

</pre><p>The resulting polynomial has the same coefficients as the resulting vector from the <tt>conv</tt> function above.
      </p>
      <h2>Matrices<a name="46"></a></h2>
      <p>Entering matrices into MATLAB is the same as entering a vector, except each row of elements is separated by a semicolon (;)
         or a return:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">B = [1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8; 9 10 11 12]

B = [ 1  2  3  4
      5  6  7  8
      9 10 11 12 ]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">B =
     1     2     3     4
     5     6     7     8
     9    10    11    12
B =
     1     2     3     4
     5     6     7     8
     9    10    11    12
</pre><p>Matrices in MATLAB can be manipulated in many ways.  For one, you can find the transpose of a matrix using the apostrophe
         key:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">C = B'
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">C =
     1     5     9
     2     6    10
     3     7    11
     4     8    12
</pre><p>It should be noted that if <i>C</i> has been complex, the apostrophe would have actually given the complex conjugate transpose.  To get the transpose in this
         case, use <tt>.'</tt> (the two commands are the same if the matrix is not complex).
      </p>
      <p>Now you can multiply the two matrices <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> together.  Remember that order matters when multiplying matrices.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">D = B * C

D = C * B
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">D =
    30    70   110
    70   174   278
   110   278   446
D =
   107   122   137   152
   122   140   158   176
   137   158   179   200
   152   176   200   224
</pre><p>Another option for matrix manipulation is that you can multiply the corresponding elements of two matrices using the <tt>.*</tt> operator (the matrices must be the same size to do this).
      </p><pre class="codeinput">E = [1 2; 3 4]
F = [2 3; 4 5]
G = E .* F
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">E =
     1     2
     3     4
F =
     2     3
     4     5
G =
     2     6
    12    20
</pre><p>If you have a square matrix, like <i>E</i>, you can also multiply it by itself as many times as you like by raising it to a given power.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">E^3
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
    37    54
    81   118
</pre><p>If you wanted to cube each element in the matrix, just use the element-by-element cubing.</p><pre class="codeinput">E.^3
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
     1     8
    27    64
</pre><p>You can also find the inverse of a matrix:</p><pre class="codeinput">X = inv(E)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">X =
   -2.0000    1.0000
    1.5000   -0.5000
</pre><p>or its eigenvalues:</p><pre class="codeinput">eig(E)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
   -0.3723
    5.3723
</pre><p>There is even a function to find the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix.  The <tt>poly</tt> function creates a vector that includes the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">p = poly(E)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">p =
    1.0000   -5.0000   -2.0000
</pre><p>Remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix are the same as the roots of its characteristic polynomial:</p><pre class="codeinput">roots(p)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
    5.3723
   -0.3723
</pre><h2>Printing<a name="67"></a></h2>

%%
% MATLAB is an interactive program for numerical computation and data
% visualization; it is used extensively by control engineers for analysis 
% and design. There are many different toolboxes available which extend the
% basic functions of MATLAB into different application areas; in these 
% tutorials, we will make extensive use of the Control Systems Toolbox. 
% MATLAB is supported on Unix, Macintosh, and Windows environments; a 
% student version of MATLAB is available for personal computers. For more 
% information on MATLAB, please visit the MathWorks link at the top of the
% page.
% 
%%
% The idea behind these tutorials is that you can view them in one window
% while running MATLAB in another window. You should be able to re-do all 
% of the plots and calculations in the tutorials by cutting and pasting 
% text from the tutorials into MATLAB or an |m-file|. 
%
%% Vectors
%
% Let's start off by creating something simple, like a vector. Enter each
% element of the vector (separated by a space) between brackets, and set it
% equal to a variable. For example, to create the vector *a*, enter the 
% following into the MATLAB command window (you can *Copy* and *Paste* from
% your browser into MATLAB to make it easy) and MATLAB should return the 
% following:
%
%%

a = [1 2 3 4 5 6 9 8 7]

%%
% Let's say you want to create a vector with elements between 0 and 20
% evenly spaced in increments of two (this method is frequently used to
% create a time vector):
%
%%

t = 0:2:20

%%
% Manipulating vectors is almost as easy as creating them.  First, suppose
% you would like to add 2 to each of the elements in the vector *a*.  The
% equation for that looks like:
%
%%

b = a + 2

%%
% Now suppose, you would like to add two vectors together. If the two
% vectors are the same length, it is easy. Simply add the two as shown 
% below:
%
%%

c = a + b

%%
% Subtraction of vectors of the same length works exactly the same way.
%
%% Functions
%
% To make life easier, MATLAB includes many standard functions. Each
% function is a block of code that accomplishes a specific task. MATLAB 
% contains all of the standard functions such as |sin|, |cos|, |log|, 
% |exp|, |sqrt|, as well as many others. Commonly used constants such as 
% |pi|, and |i| or |j| for the square root of -1, are also incorporated 
% into MATLAB.
%
%%

sin(pi/4)

%%
% To determine the usage of any function, type |help [function name]| at 
% the MATLAB command window. 
%
%%
% MATLAB even allows you to write your own functions with the *|function|*
% command; follow the link to learn how to write your own functions and see
% a listing of the functions we created for this tutorial.
%
%% Plotting
%
% It is also easy to create plots in MATLAB. Suppose you wanted to plot a
% sine wave as a function of time. First, make a time vector (the semicolon
% after each statement tells MATLAB we don't want to see all the values) 
% and then compute the sin value at each time.  The commands after the
% |plot| function (|title|, |xlabel|, |ylabel|) will add annotations to the
% plot.
%
%%

t = 0:0.25:7;
y = sin(t);

plot(t,y)
title('Sine Wave as a Function of Time')
xlabel('Time (secs)')
ylabel('Amplitude')

%%
% The plot contains approximately one period of a sine wave. Basic plotting
% is very easy in MATLAB, and the |plot| command has extensive add-on 
% capabilities. I would recommend you visit the *plotting* page to learn 
% more about it.
%
%% Polynomials as Vectors
%
% In MATLAB, a polynomial is represented by a vector. To create a
% polynomial in MATLAB, simply enter each coefficient of the polynomial 
% into the vector in descending order. For instance, let's say you have the
% following polynomial:
%
% $$
% s^4 + 3s^3 - 15s^2 - 2s +9
% $$
%
%%
% To enter this into MATLAB, just enter it as a vector in the following
% manner:
%
%%

x = [1 3 -15 -2 9]

%%
% MATLAB can interpret a vector of length n+1 as an nth order polynomial.
% Thus, if your polynomial is missing any coefficients, you must enter 
% zeros in the appropriate place in the vector. For example,
%
% $$
% s^4 + 1
% $$
%
%%
% would be represented in MATLAB as:
%
%%

y = [1 0 0 0 1]

%%
% You can find the value of a polynomial using the |polyval| function.  For
% example, to find the value of the above polynomial at |s = 2|,
%
%%

z = polyval([1 0 0 0 1],2)

%%
% You can also extract the roots of a polynomial.  This is useful when you
% have a high-order polynomial such as
%
% $$
% s^4 + 3s^3 - 15s^2 - 2s + 9
% $$
%
%%
% Finding the roots would be as easy as entering the following command:
%
%%

roots([1 3 -15 -2 9])

%%
% Let's say you want to multiply two polynomials together. The product of
% two polynomials is found by taking the convolution of their coefficients.
% MATLAB's function |conv| will do this for you.
%
%%

x = [1 2];
y = [1 4 8];
z = conv(x,y)

%%
% Dividing two polynomials is just as easy.  The |deconv| function will 
% return the remainder as well as the result.  Let's divide |z| by |y| and 
% see if we get |x|.
%
%%

[xx, R] = deconv(z,y)

%%
% As you can see, this is just the polynomial/vector |x| from before. If 
% |y| had not gone into |z| evenly, the remainder vector would have been 
% something other than zero.
%
%% Polynomials Using the s Variable
%
% Another way to represent a polynomial is to use the Laplace variable |s|
% within MATLAB.  This method is mainly used throughout these tutorials.
% Let's ignore the details of the Laplace domain for now and just represent
% polynomials with the |s| variable.  To define the variable, type the
% following into the MATLAB command window:
%
%%

s = tf('s')

%%
% Recall the polynomial given above:
%
% $$
% s^4 + 3s^3 - 15s^2 - 2s +9
% $$
%
%%
% To represent this in MATLAB, type the following into the MATLAB command
% window:
%
%%

polynomial = s^4 + 3*s^3 - 15*s^2 - 2*s + 9

%%
% Instead of using the |roots| function, we can use the |zero| function to
% find the roots of the polynomial.
%
%%

zero(polynomial)

%%
% As you can see, the result is the same as above using the |roots| command
% and the coefficients of the polynomial.
%
%%
% You can also multiply two polynomials together using the |s| variable.
% Let's redefine |x| and |y|.
%
%%

x = s + 2;
y = s^2 + 4*s + 8;
z = x * y

%%
% The resulting polynomial has the same coefficients as the resulting
% vector from the |conv| function above.
%
%% Matrices
%
% Entering matrices into MATLAB is the same as entering a vector, except
% each row of elements is separated by a semicolon (;) or a return:
%
%%

B = [1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8; 9 10 11 12]

B = [ 1  2  3  4
      5  6  7  8
      9 10 11 12 ]
  
%%
% Matrices in MATLAB can be manipulated in many ways.  For one, you can
% find the transpose of a matrix using the apostrophe key:
%
%%

C = B'

%%
% It should be noted that if _C_ has been complex, the apostrophe would 
% have actually given the complex conjugate transpose.  To get the 
% transpose in this case, use |.'| (the two commands are the same if the 
% matrix is not complex).
%
%%
% Now you can multiply the two matrices _B_ and _C_ together.  Remember 
% that order matters when multiplying matrices.
%
%%

D = B * C

D = C * B

%%
% Another option for matrix manipulation is that you can multiply the
% corresponding elements of two matrices using the |.*| operator (the 
% matrices must be the same size to do this).
%
%%

E = [1 2; 3 4]
F = [2 3; 4 5]
G = E .* F

%%
% If you have a square matrix, like _E_, you can also multiply it by itself
% as many times as you like by raising it to a given power.
%
%%

E^3

%%
% If you wanted to cube each element in the matrix, just use the
% element-by-element cubing.
%
%%

E.^3

%%
% You can also find the inverse of a matrix:
%
%% 

X = inv(E)

%%
% or its eigenvalues:
%
%%

eig(E)

%%
% There is even a function to find the coefficients of the characteristic
% polynomial of a matrix.  The |poly| function creates a vector that
% includes the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.
%
%%

p = poly(E)

%%
% Remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix are the same as the roots of
% its characteristic polynomial:
%
%%

roots(p)

%% Printing
%
% Printing in MATLAB is pretty easy.  Just follow the steps illustrated
% below:
%
%%
% *Macintosh*
%
%%
% * To print a plot or a |m-file| from a Macintosh, just click on the plot
% or |m-file|, select *Print* under the *File* menu, and hit *Return*.
%
%%
% *Windows*
%
%%
% * To print a plot or a |m-file| from a computer running Windows, just 
% select *Print* from the *File* menu in the window of the plot or 
% |m-file|, and hit *Return*.
%
%%
% *Unix*
%
%%
% * To print a plot on a Unix workstation enter the command: 
% |print -P<printername>|.
% * If you want to save the plot and print it later, enter the command:
% |print plot.ps|.
% * Sometime later, you could print the plot using the command 
% |lpr -P plot.ps| If you are using a HP workstation to print, you would 
% instead use the command |lpr -d plot.ps|.
% * To print a |m-file|, just print it the way you would any other file,
% using the command |lpr -P _name of m-file_.m|.  If you are using a HP 
% workstation to print, you would instead use the command 
% |lpr -d plot.ps _name of m-file_.m|.
%
%% Using m-files in MATLAB
%
% There are slightly different things you need to know for each platform.
%
%%
% *Macintosh*
%
%%
% * There is a built-in editor for |m-files|; choose *New M-file* from the
% *File* menu. You can also use any other editor you like (but be sure to 
% save the files in text format and load them when you start MATLAB).
%
%%
% *Windows*
%
%%
% * Running MATLAB from Windows is very similar to running it on a
% Macintosh. However, you need to know that your |m-file| will be saved in 
% the clipboard.  Therefore, you must make sure that it is saved as 
% |filename.m|.
%
%%
% *Unix*
%
%%
% * You will need to run an editor separately from MATLAB. The best
% strategy is to make a directory for all your |m-files|, then |cd| to that
% directory before running both MATLAB and the editor. To start MATLAB from
% your Xterm window, simply type: |matlab|.
%
%%
% You can either type commands directly into MATLAB, or put all of the
% commands that you will need together in a |m-file|, and just run the 
% file.  If you put all of your |m-files| in the same directory that you 
% run MATLAB from, then MATLAB  will always find them.
%
%% Getting Help in MATLAB
%
% MATLAB has a fairly good on-line help, type:
%
%%
% |help commandname|
%
%%
% for more information on any given command.  You do need to know the name
% of the command that you are looking for; a list of the all the ones used 
% in these tutorials is given in the *command listing*; a link to this page
% can be found at top right of this page.
%
%%
% Here are a few notes to end this tutorial.
%
%%
% You can get the value of a particular variable at any time by typing its
% name.
%
%%

B

%%
% You can also have more than one statement on a single line, so long as
% you separate them with either a semicolon or comma.
%
%%
% Also, you may have noticed that so long as you dont assign a variable a
% specific operation or result, MATLAB will store it in a temporary
% variable called |ans|.
