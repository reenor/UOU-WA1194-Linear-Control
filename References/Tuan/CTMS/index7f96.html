      </div>
      <p>One of the most important functions in MATLAB is the <tt>plot</tt> function. The <tt>plot</tt> command also happens to be one of the easiest functions to learn how to use. The basic syntax of the function call is shown
         below. This code can be entered in the MATLAB command window or run from an <a href="indexd754.html?aux=Extras_Mfile">m-file</a>.
      </p><pre>      plot(x,y)</pre><p>This command will plot the elements of vector <tt>y</tt> (on the vertical axis of a figure) versus the elements of the vector <tt>x</tt> (on the horizontal axis of the figure). The default is that each time the plot command is issued, the current figure will
         be erased; we will discuss how to override this below. Consider the following simple, linear function.
      </p><pre>        y=3x</pre><p>If we wished to plot this function, we could create an m-file with the following code to generate the basic plot shown below.</p><pre class="codeinput">         x = 0:0.1:100;
         y = 3*x;
         plot(x,y)
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Plot_01.png" alt=""> <p>One thing to keep in mind when using the <tt>plot</tt> command is that the vectors <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> must be the same length. The other dimension can vary. MATLAB can plot a <tt>1 x n</tt> vector versus an <tt>n x 1</tt> vector, or a <tt>1 x n</tt> vector versus a <tt>2 x n</tt> matrix (you will generate two lines), as long as <tt>n</tt> is the same for both vectors.
      </p>
      <p>The <tt>plot</tt> command can also be used with just one input vector. In that case the vector columns are plotted versus their indices (the
         vector <tt>[1:1:n]</tt> will be used for the horizontal axis). If the input vector contains complex numbers, MATLAB plots the real part of each element
         (on the horizontal axis) versus the imaginary part (on the vertical axis).
      </p>
      <h2>Plot aesthetics<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>The color, point marker, and line style can be changed on a plot by adding a third parameter (in single quotes) to the <tt>plot</tt> command. For example, to plot the above function as a red, dotted line, change the m-file as follows to generate the figure
         shown below.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">          x = 0:0.1:100;
          y = 3*x;
          plot(x,y,<span class="string">'r:'</span>)
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Plot_02.png" alt=""> <p>The third input consists of one to three characters which specify a color, point marker type, and/or line style. The list
         of colors, point markers, and line styles are summarized below.
      </p><pre>         y     yellow        .     point              -     solid
         m     magenta       o     circle             :     dotted
         c     cyan          x     x-mark             -.    dashdot
         r     red           +     plus               --    dashed
         g     green         *     star
         b     blue          s     square
         w     white         d     diamond
         k     black         v     triangle (down)
                             ^     triangle (up)
                             &lt;     triangle (left)
                             &gt;     triangle (right)
                             p     pentagram
                             h     hexagram</pre><p>You can also plot more than one function on the same figure. Let's say you want to plot a sine wave and cosine wave on the
         same set of axes, using a different color and style for each. The following m-file will plot a sine wave and cosine wave,
         with the sine wave as a solid red line and the cosine wave as a series of green <tt>x</tt>'s.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">         x = linspace(0,2*pi,50);
         y = sin(x);
         z = cos(x);
         plot(x,y,<span class="string">'r'</span>, x,z,<span class="string">'gx'</span>)
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Plot_03.png" alt=""> <p>By adding more sets of parameters to <tt>plot</tt>, you can plot as many different data sets on the same figure as you want. When plotting many things on the same graph it
         is useful to differentiate the different data sets based on color and point marker. This same effect can also be achieved
         using the <tt>hold on</tt> and <tt>hold off</tt> commands. The same plot shown above could be generated using the following code.
      </p>
      <p>
         </p><pre class="codeinput">
         x = linspace(0,2*pi,50);
         y = sin(x);
         plot(x,y,'r')
         z = cos(x);
         hold on
         plot(x,z,'gx')
         hold off
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <p>Always remember that if you use the <tt>hold on</tt> command all plots from then on will be generated on one set of axes without erasing the previous plot until the <tt>hold off</tt> command is issued.
      </p>
      <h2>Subplotting<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>More than one plot can be put in the same figure on its own set of axes using the <tt>subplot</tt> command. The <tt>subplot</tt> command allows you to separate the figure into as many plots as desired, and put them all in one figure. To use this command,
         the following line of code is entered into the MATLAB command window or run from an m-file.
      </p><pre>        subplot(m,n,p)</pre><p>This command splits the figure into a matrix of <tt>m</tt> rows and <tt>n</tt> columns, thereby creating <tt>m*n</tt> plots on one figure. The <tt>p</tt>'th plot is selected as the currently active plot. For instance, suppose you want to see a sine wave, cosine wave, and tangent
         wave plotted on the same figure, but not on the same axes. The following code will accomplish this.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">          x = linspace(0,2*pi,50);
          y = sin(x);
          z = cos(x);
          w = tan(x);

          subplot(2,2,1)
          plot(x,y)
          subplot(2,2,2)
          plot(x,z)
          subplot(2,2,3)
          plot(x,w)
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Plot_04.png" alt=""> <p>As you can see, there are only three plots, even though we created a 2 x 2 matrix of 4 subplots. We did this to show that
         you do not have to fill all of the subplots you have created, but MATLAB will leave a spot for every position in the matrix.
         We could have easily made another plot using the <tt>subplot(2,2,4)</tt> command. The subplots are arranged in the same manner as you would read a book. The first subplot is in the top left corner,
         the next is to its right. When all the columns in that row are filled, the left-most column on the next row down is filled
         (all of this is assuming that you fill your subplots in order (i.e. 1, 2, 3,...).
      </p>
      <p>One thing to note about the subplot command is that every plot command issued later will place the plot in whichever subplot
         position was last used, erasing the plot that was previously in it. For example, in the m-file above, if a plot command was
         issued later, it would be plotted in the third position in the subplot, erasing the tangent plot. To avoid this problem, the
         figure should be cleared (using <tt>clf</tt>), or a new figure should be specified (using <tt>figure</tt>).
      </p>
      <h2>Changing the axes<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>Now that you have found different ways to plot functions, you can customize your plots. One of the most important ways to
         do this is with the <tt>axis</tt> command. The <tt>axis</tt> command changes the axis of the plot shown, so only the part of the axis that is desirable is displayed. The <tt>axis</tt> command is used by entering the following code right after the <tt>plot</tt> command (or any command that has a plot as an output).
      </p><pre>        axis([xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax])</pre><p>For instance, suppose want to look at a plot of the function y=exp(5t)-1. The following lines of code will accomplish this.</p><pre class="codeinput">     clf <span class="comment">%if needed, this clears the previous subplot</span>
     t=0:0.01:5;
     y=exp(5*t)-1;
     plot(t,y)
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Plot_05.png" alt=""> <p>As you can see, the plot goes to infinity. Looking at the vertical axis (scale: 8e10), it is apparent that the function gets
         large very quickly. To get a better idea of the initial behavior of the function, let's resize the axes. Enter the following
         command into the MATLAB command window to get a plot focused on the first second of the function.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">     axis([0, 1, 0, 50])
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Plot_06.png" alt=""> <p>This plot may be more useful, you can now clearly see what is going on as the function moves toward infinity. When using the
         <tt>subplot</tt> command, the axes can be changed for each subplot by issuing an <tt>axis</tt> command before the next subplot command. There are more uses of the <tt>axis</tt> command which you can see if you type <tt>help axis</tt> or <tt>doc axis</tt> in the MATLAB command window.
      </p>
      <h2>Adding text and legend<a name="13"></a></h2>
      <p>Another thing that may be important for your plots is labeling. You can give your plot a title (with the <tt>title</tt> command), <i>x</i>-axis label (with the <tt>xlabel</tt> command), <i>y</i>-axis label (with the <tt>ylabel</tt> command), and put text on the actual plot. All of the above commands are issued after the actual <tt>plot</tt> command has been issued.
      </p>
      <p>A title will be placed, centered, above the plot with the command: <tt>title('title string')</tt>. The <i>x</i>-axis label is issued with the command <tt>xlabel('x-axis string')</tt>, while the <i>y</i>-axis label is issued with the command <tt>ylabel('y-axis string')</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, text can be put on the plot itself in one of two ways: the <tt>text</tt> command and the <tt>gtext</tt> command. The first command involves knowing the coordinates of where you want the text string. The syntax of the command
         is <tt>text(xcor,ycor,'textstring')</tt>. To use the other command, you do not need to know the exact coordinates. The syntax is <tt>gtext('textstring')</tt> which provides a set of cross-hairs that you can move to the desired location with your mouse and click on the position where
         you want the text to be placed.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, a legend can be added to the plot to identify various curves. The command is <tt>legend('string1','string2','string3')</tt>. You can specify as many text strings as there are curves in the plot. The default location of the legend is in the top-right
         corner, but this can be modified with a parameter called <tt>Location</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>To demonstrate labeling, let's modify the exponential plot from above. Assuming that you have already changed the axes, copying
         the following lines of text after the <tt>axis</tt> command will put all the labels and a legend on the plot.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">          title(<span class="string">'exponential function'</span>)
          xlabel(<span class="string">'time (sec)'</span>)
          ylabel(<span class="string">'output'</span>)
          legend(<span class="string">'exponential curve'</span>,<span class="string">'Location'</span>,<span class="string">'SouthEast'</span>)
          text(0.2,35,<span class="string">'unnecessary labeling'</span>)
</pre><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Plot_07.png" alt=""> <p>Other commands that can be used with the plot command are:</p>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li><tt>figure</tt> (opens a new figure to plot on, so the previous figure is preserved)
            </li>
            <li><tt>close</tt> (closes the current figure window)
            </li>
            <li><tt>loglog</tt> (same as <tt>plot</tt>, except both axes are log base 10 scale)
            </li>
            <li><tt>semilogx</tt> (same as <tt>plot</tt>, except the <i>x</i>-axis is log base 10 scale)
            </li>
            <li><tt>semilogy</tt> (same as <tt>plot</tt>, except tje <i>y</i>-axis is log base 10 scale)
            </li>
            <li><tt>plotyy</tt> (plots two curves with two axes, one on the right and one on the left)
            </li>
            <li><tt>grid</tt> (adds grid lines to your plot)
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Using the Plot Editor<a name="15"></a></h2>
      <p>In addition to entering commands in the command window to edit your plots, you can also edit plots interactively using the
         toolbar or drop-down menus of any figure, or by double-clicking on portions of a figure. You can specifically open the <b>Plot Editor</b> using the command <tt>plottools</tt> or by clicking on the icon shown below located at the right of a figure's toolbar.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_icon.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The <b>Plot Editor</b> consists of three windows that automatically open and surround the original plot the first time the tool is used. To the
         left is the <b>Figures Palette</b>, to the right is the <b>Plot Browser</b>, and at the bottom is the <b>Property Editor</b>. A picture of the <b>Plot Editor</b> is shown below. MATLAB will remember the last confguration used, therefore, if any of these windows were closed in the previous
         session, they will not appear when the <b>Plot Editor</b> is opened. Typing the commands <tt>figurepalette</tt>, <tt>plotbrowser</tt>, or <tt>propertyeditor</tt> in the command window can also open each of these windows independently.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_window.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>To adjust the axes of the plot for example, select the axes, then change the axis limits which appear in the <b>Property Editor</b> at the bottom of the plot.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_axes.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The <b>Property Editor</b> can also be used to set the <b>Title</b>, <b>X label</b>, and <b>Y label</b> of the plot, as well as the <b>Colors</b> and line styles of the data.
      </p>
      <p>To add new data to the plot, select the <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> data from the <b>Figures Palette</b> in the left window (use the <b>Ctrl</b> key to select more than one item) and drag them into the plot. Using <tt>y2 = 2*exp(5*t)-1;</tt>, the following plot results.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_figure.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>Use the <b>Plot Browser</b> on the right side of the plot to select which data should be displayed. If you have sub-plots, you can also select or deselect
         which ones should be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>Of course this is not a complete account of plotting with MATLAB, but it should give you a nice start.</p>

%        plot(x,y)
%
% This command will plot the elements of vector |y| (on the vertical axis of
% a figure) versus the elements of the vector |x| (on the horizontal axis of the
% figure). The default is that each time the plot command is issued, the
% current figure will be erased; we will discuss how to override this
% below. Consider the following simple, linear function.
%
%          y=3x
% 
% If we wished to plot this function, we could create an m-file with the following code to
% generate the basic plot shown below. 
% 
         x = 0:0.1:100;
         y = 3*x;
         plot(x,y)

%%
% One thing to keep in mind when using the |plot| command is that the
% vectors |x| and |y| must be the same length. The other dimension can vary.
% MATLAB can plot a |1 x n| vector versus an |n x 1| vector, or a |1 x n| vector
% versus a |2 x n| matrix (you will generate two lines), as long as |n| is the same
% for both vectors.
% 
% The |plot| command can also be used with just one input vector. In that
% case the vector columns are plotted versus their indices (the vector
% |[1:1:n]| will be used for the horizontal axis). If the input vector contains
% complex numbers, MATLAB plots the real part of each element (on the
% horizontal axis) versus the imaginary part (on the vertical axis).
%% Plot aesthetics
% 
% The color, point marker, and line style can be changed on a plot by adding a third
% parameter (in single quotes) to the |plot| command. For example, to plot
% the above function as a red, dotted line, change the m-file as follows to
% generate the figure shown below.

          x = 0:0.1:100;
          y = 3*x;
          plot(x,y,'r:')

%% 
% The third input consists of one to three characters which specify a
% color, point marker type, and/or line style. The list of colors, point
% markers, and line styles are summarized below.
% 
%           y     yellow        .     point              -     solid
%           m     magenta       o     circle             :     dotted
%           c     cyan          x     x-mark             -.    dashdot 
%           r     red           +     plus               REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH    dashed   
%           g     green         *     star
%           b     blue          s     square
%           w     white         d     diamond
%           k     black         v     triangle (down)
%                               ^     triangle (up)
%                               <     triangle (left)
%                               >     triangle (right)
%                               p     pentagram
%                               h     hexagram
% 
%%
% You can also plot more than one function on the same figure. Let's say you
% want to plot a sine wave and cosine wave on the same set of axes, using a
% different color and style for each. The following m-file will plot 
% a sine wave and cosine wave, with the sine wave as a solid red line and
% the cosine wave as a series of green |x|'s. 
% 
         x = linspace(0,2*pi,50);
         y = sin(x);
         z = cos(x);
         plot(x,y,'r', x,z,'gx')

%% 
% By adding more sets of parameters to |plot|, you can plot as many
% different data sets on the same figure as you want. When plotting many
% things on the same graph it is useful to differentiate the different
% data sets based on color and point marker. This same effect can also be 
% achieved using the |hold on| and |hold off| commands. The same plot shown
% above could be generated using the following code. 
% 
% <html>
% </p><pre class="codeinput">
% x = linspace(0,2*pi,50);
% y = sin(x);
% plot(x,y,'r')
% z = cos(x);
% hold on 
% plot(x,z,'gx')
% hold off
% </pre>
% </html>
%% 
% Always remember that if you use the |hold on| command all plots from
% then on will be generated on one set of axes without erasing the
% previous plot until the |hold off| command is issued.
%% Subplotting
% 
% More than one plot can be put in the same figure on its own set of axes
% using the |subplot| command. The |subplot| command allows you to separate
% the figure into as many plots as desired, and put them all in one figure.
% To use this command, the following line of code is entered into the
% MATLAB command window or run from an m-file.
% 
%          subplot(m,n,p)
% 
% This command splits the figure into a matrix of |m| rows and |n| columns,
% thereby creating |m*n| plots on one figure. The |p|'th plot is selected as
% the currently active plot. For instance, suppose you want to see a sine
% wave, cosine wave, and tangent wave plotted on the same figure, but not
% on the same axes. The following code will accomplish this.

          x = linspace(0,2*pi,50);
          y = sin(x);
          z = cos(x);
          w = tan(x);
 
          subplot(2,2,1)
          plot(x,y)
          subplot(2,2,2)
          plot(x,z)
          subplot(2,2,3)
          plot(x,w) 
%% 
% As you can see, there are only three plots, even though we created a 2 x
% 2 matrix of 4 subplots. We did this to show that you do not have to fill
% all of the subplots you have created, but MATLAB will leave a spot for
% every position in the matrix. We could have easily made another plot
% using the |subplot(2,2,4)| command. The subplots are arranged in the same
% manner as you would read a book. The first subplot is in the top left
% corner, the next is to its right. When all the columns in that row are
% filled, the left-most column on the next row down is filled (all of this
% is assuming that you fill your subplots in order (i.e. 1, 2, 3,...).
% 
% One thing to note about the subplot command is that every plot command
% issued later will place the plot in whichever subplot position was last
% used, erasing the plot that was previously in it. For example, in the
% m-file above, if a plot command was issued later, it would
% be plotted in the third position in the subplot, erasing the tangent
% plot. To avoid this problem, the figure should be cleared (using |clf|),
% or a new figure should be specified (using |figure|).
%% Changing the axes
% 
% Now that you have found different ways to plot functions, you can
% customize your plots. One of the most important ways to do
% this is with the |axis| command. The |axis| command changes the axis of
% the plot shown, so only the part of the axis that is desirable is
% displayed. The |axis| command is used by entering the following code
% right after the |plot| command (or any command that has a plot as an
% output).
% 
%          axis([xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax])
% 
% For instance, suppose want to look at a plot of the function y=exp(5t)-1.
% The following lines of code will accomplish this.
% 
     clf %if needed, this clears the previous subplot
     t=0:0.01:5;
     y=exp(5*t)-1;
     plot(t,y)

%% 
% As you can see, the plot goes to infinity. Looking at the vertical axis (scale:
% 8e10), it is apparent that the function gets large very quickly. To get a
% better idea of the initial behavior of the function, let's resize the
% axes. Enter the following command into the MATLAB command window to get a
% plot focused on the first second of the function.

     axis([0, 1, 0, 50])

%% 
% This plot may be more useful, you can now clearly see what is going
% on as the function moves toward infinity. When using the |subplot|
% command, the axes can be changed for 
% each subplot by issuing an |axis| command before the next subplot command.
% There are more uses of the |axis| command which you can see if you type
% |help axis| or |doc axis| in the MATLAB command window.
%% Adding text and legend
% 
% Another thing that may be important for your plots is labeling. You can
% give your plot a title (with the |title| command), _x_-axis label (with the
% |xlabel| command), _y_-axis label (with the |ylabel| command), and put text
% on the actual plot. All of the above commands are issued after the actual
% |plot| command has been issued.
% 
% A title will be placed, centered, above the plot with the command:
% |title('title string')|. The _x_-axis label is issued with the
% command |xlabel('x-axis string')|, while the _y_-axis label is issued with the
% command |ylabel('y-axis string')|.
% 
% Furthermore, text can be put on the plot itself in one of two ways: the
% |text| command and the |gtext| command. The first command involves knowing
% the coordinates of where you want the text string. The syntax of the command is
% |text(xcor,ycor,'textstring')|. To use the other command, you do not need
% to know the exact coordinates. The syntax is |gtext('textstring')| which
% provides a set of cross-hairs that you can move to the desired location
% with your mouse and click on the position where you want the text to be placed.
%
% Finally, a legend can be added to the plot to identify various curves.
% The command is |legend('string1','string2','string3')|. You can specify
% as many text strings as there are curves in the plot. The default
% location of the legend is in the top-right corner, but this can be
% modified with a parameter called |Location|.
% 
% To demonstrate labeling, let's modify the exponential plot from above.
% Assuming that you have already changed the axes, copying the following
% lines of text after the |axis| command will put all the labels and a legend
% on the plot.
% 
          title('exponential function')
          xlabel('time (sec)')
          ylabel('output')
          legend('exponential curve','Location','SouthEast')
          text(0.2,35,'unnecessary labeling')  
%% 
% Other commands that can be used with the plot command are:
% 
% * |figure| (opens a new figure to plot on, so the previous figure is preserved)
% * |close| (closes the current figure window)
% * |loglog| (same as |plot|, except both axes are log base 10 scale)
% * |semilogx| (same as |plot|, except the _x_-axis is log base 10 scale)
% * |semilogy| (same as |plot|, except tje _y_-axis is log base 10 scale)
% * |plotyy| (plots two curves with two axes, one on the right and one on the left)
% * |grid| (adds grid lines to your plot) 
% 
%% Using the Plot Editor
% 
% In addition to entering commands in the command window to edit your
% plots, you can also edit plots interactively using the toolbar or
% drop-down menus of any figure, or by double-clicking on portions of a
% figure. You can specifically open the *Plot Editor* using the command |plottools|
% or by clicking on the icon shown below located at the right of a figure's toolbar. 
%
% <<Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_icon.png>>
%
% The *Plot Editor* consists of three windows that automatically open and
% surround the original plot the first time the tool is used. To the left
% is the *Figures Palette*, to the right is the *Plot Browser*, and at the
% bottom is the *Property Editor*. A picture of the *Plot Editor* is shown
% below. MATLAB will remember the last confguration used, therefore, if any
% of these windows were closed in the previous session, they will not
% appear when the *Plot Editor* is opened. Typing the commands
% |figurepalette|, |plotbrowser|, or |propertyeditor| in the command window
% can also open each of these windows independently.   
% 
% <<Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_window.png>>
% 
% To adjust the axes of the plot for example, select the axes, then change the axis
% limits which appear in the *Property Editor* at the bottom of the plot.
%
% <<Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_axes.png>>
%
% The *Property Editor* can also be used to set the *Title*, *X label*, and
% *Y label* of the plot, as well as the *Colors* and line styles of the data.
%
% To add new data to the plot, select the |x| and |y| data from the *Figures
% Palette* in the left window (use the *Ctrl* key to select more than one
% item) and drag them into the plot. Using |y2 = 2*exp(5*t)-1;|, the
% following plot results.
%
% <<Content/Extras/figures/plot_tools_figure.png>>
%
% Use the *Plot Browser* on the right side of the plot to select which data
% should be displayed. If you have sub-plots, you can also select or
% deselect which ones should be displayed.
%
% Of course this is not a complete account of plotting with MATLAB, but it
% should give you a nice start.
