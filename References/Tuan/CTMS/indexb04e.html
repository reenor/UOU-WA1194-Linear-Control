      <p>For a step reference of 0.2 radians, the design criteria are the following.</p>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li>Overshoot less than 10%</li>

            <li>Steady-state error less than 2%</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Recall from the <a href="index6e33.html?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlPID">Introduction: PID Controller Design</a> page that the transfer function for a PID controller is the following.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(2)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/html/AircraftPitch_ControlPID_eq68438.png" alt="$$ C(s) = K_{p} + \frac {K_{i}}{s} + K_{d}s = \frac{K_{d}s^2 + K_{p}s +&#xA;K_{i}}{s} $$"></p>
      <p>We will implement combinations of proportional (<i>Kp</i>), integral (<i>Ki</i>), and derivative (<i>Kd</i>) control in the unity feedback architecture shown below in order to achieve the desired system behavior.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/feedback_pitch2.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>In particular, we will take advantage of the automated tuning capabilities of the <b>SISO Design Tool</b> within MATLAB to design our PID controller. First, enter the following code at the command line to define the model of our
         plant <i>P</i>(<i>s</i>). Refer to the <a href="index1987.html?example=AircraftPitch&amp;section=SystemModeling">Aircraft Pitch: System Modeling</a> page for the details of getting these commands.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">s = tf(<span class="string">'s'</span>);
P_pitch = (1.151*s+0.1774)/(s^3+0.739*s^2+0.921*s);
</pre><h2>Proportional control<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>Let's begin by designing a proportional controller of the form <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) = <i>Kp</i>. The <b>SISO Design Tool</b> we will use for design can be opened by typing <tt>sisotool(P_pitch)</tt> at the command line. This will open both the <b>SISO Design Task</b> window as well as the <b>Control and Estimation Tools Manager</b> window. The <b>SISO Design Task</b> window will initially open with a root locus and Bode plot for the provided plant transfer function and can be employed for
         graphically tuning a controller. Since we are going to apply the automated tuning function of the <b>SISO Design Tool</b>, you may close the <b>SISO Design Task</b> window.
      </p>
      <p>The <b>Control and Estimation Tools Manager</b> window displays the architecture of the control system being designed as shown below. This default agrees with the architecture
         we are employing.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture1.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>Since our reference is a step function of 0.2 radians, we can set the precompensator block <i>F</i>(<i>s</i>) equal to 0.2 to scale a unit step input to our system. This can be accomplished from the <b>Compensator Editor</b> tab of the open window. Specifically, choose <tt>F</tt> from the drop-down menu in the <b>Compensator</b> portion of the window and set the compensator equal to 0.2 as shown in the figure below.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture2.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>To begin with, let's see how the system performs with a proportional controller <i>Kp</i> set equal to 2. The compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) can be defined in the same manner as the precompensator, just choose <tt>C</tt> from from the drop-down menu in the <b>Compensator</b> portion of the window instead of <tt>F</tt>. Then set the compensator equal to 2. To see the performance of our system with this controller, go to the <b>Analysis Plots</b> tab of the <b>Control and Estimation Tools Manager</b> window. Then choose a <b>Plot Type</b> of <tt>Step</tt> for <b>Plot 1</b> in the <b>Analysis Plots</b> section of the window as shown below. Then choose a response of <b>Closed loop r to y</b> for <b>Plot 1</b> as shown in the figure below.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture3.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>A window will then open with the following step response displayed.</p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture4.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>Examination of the above shows that aside from steady-state error, the given design requirements have not been met. The gain
         chosen for <i>Kp</i> can be adjusted in an attempt to modify the resulting performance through the <b>Compensator Editor</b> tab. Instead, we will use the <b>SISO Design Tool</b> to automatically tune our proportional compensator. In order to use this feature, go to the <b>Automated Tuning</b> tab and choose <tt>PID Tuning</tt> from the <b>Design method</b> drop-down menu. Then select a <b>Controller type</b> of <tt>P</tt> as shown in the figure below.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture5.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>There are a range of options that can be chosen from the <b>Tuning algorithm</b> drop-down menu. These options range from heuristic techniques, like Ziegler-Nichols, to numerical approaches that search
         over all possible control gains to minimize some identified performance index that is usually related to the error <i>e</i>(<i>t</i>) in the control system. As these metrics attempt to minimize the error over time, they address both transient requirements
         such as overshoot and rise time, as well as steady-state requirements such as steady-state error. For our example, choose
         <tt>Parameter search</tt> from the <b>Tuning algorithm</b> menu. Then choose <tt>Integral Time Square Error (ITSE)</tt> as the <b>Performance metric</b>. This approach will search over a range of proportional gains to find one that minimizes the following metric.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(3)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/html/AircraftPitch_ControlPID_eq77773.png" alt="$$ ITSE = \int_0^T te(t)^2 dt $$"></p>
      <p>In order to be useful, a metric must always be greater than zero. This can be achieved by taking the absolute value of the
         error, or by squaring the error as is done in this case. An added effect of taking the square of the error is that large errors
         are penalized more heavily than small errors. The ITSE metric also multiplies the squared error by the time <i>t</i>. The effect of this is to minimize the contribution of a large initial error due to the step reference.
      </p>
      <p>Once all of the tuning settings have been chosen, you then click the <b>Update Compensator</b> button. This algorithm found that a proportional gain of <i>Kp</i> = 0.01854 minimizes the ITSE metric leading to the following closed-loop step response.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture6.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The resulting response is very slow, even slower than our somewhat randomly chosen initial gain <i>Kp</i> = 2. This seems to be related to the fact that our metric weighs error at larger values of <i>t</i> more heavily. Therefore, try changing the <b>Performance metric</b> to <tt>Integral Square Error (ISE)</tt> and click the <b>Update Compensator</b> button again. The gain that minimizes this metric is found to be <i>Kp</i> = 1 and the resulting closed-loop step response is shown below.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture7.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The resulting performance is improved, though the settle time is still much too large. We will likely need to add integral
         and/or derivative terms to our controller in order to meet the given requirements.
      </p>
      <h2>PI control<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>Recalling the information provided in the <a href="index6e33.html?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlPID">Introduction: PID Controller Design</a> tutorial integral control is often helpful in reducing steady-state error. In our case, the steady-state error requirement
         is already being met. For purposes of illustration, let's design a PI controller anyway. We will again use automated tuning
         to choose our controller gains. Under the <b>Automated Tuning</b> tab change the <b>Controller type</b> to <tt>PI</tt> and leave the <b>Tuning algorithm</b> as <tt>Parameter search</tt> and the <b>Performance metric</b> as <tt>Integral Square Error (ISE)</tt>. Clicking on the <b>Compensator Update</b> button then produces the following controller.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(4)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/html/AircraftPitch_ControlPID_eq49502.png" alt="$$ C(s) = 0.55599\frac{1 + 1.8s}{s} \approx \frac{0.56}{s} + 1.00 $$"></p>
      <p>This transfer function is a PI compensator with <i>Ki</i> = 0.56 and <i>Kp</i> = 1.00. The resulting closed-loop step response is shown below.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture8.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>From inspection of the above, notice that the addition of integral control helped reduce the average error in the signal more
         quickly. Unfortunately, the integral control also made the response more oscillatory, therefore, the settle time requirement
         is still not met. Furthermore, the overshoot requirement is no longer met either. Let's try also adding a derivative term
         to our controller.
      </p>
      <h2>PID Control<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>Again recalling the lessons we have learned in the <a href="index6e33.html?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlPID">Introduction: PID Controller Design</a> tutorial increasing the derivative gain <i>Kd</i> in a PID controller can often help reduce overshoot. Therefore, by adding derivative control we may be able to reduce the
         oscillation in the response a sufficient amount that we can then increase the other gains to reduce the settling time.  Let's
         test our hypothesis by changing the <b>Controller type</b> to <tt>PID</tt> and again clicking the <b>Update Compensator</b> button. The generated controller is shown below.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(5)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/html/AircraftPitch_ControlPID_eq71806.png" alt="$$ C(s) = 4.4545 \frac{1 + 0.22s +1.1s^2}{s} \approx \frac{4.45}{s} + 0.98 + 4.90s $$"></p>
      <p>This transfer function is a PID compensator with <i>Ki</i> = 4.45, <i>Kp</i> = 0.98, and <i>Kd</i> = 4.90. The resulting closed-loop step response is shown below.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture9.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>This response meets all of the requirements except for the settle time which at 12.6 seconds is a little larger than the given
         requirement of 10 seconds. We will attempt to increase the proportional gain in order to reduce the system's settle time.
         Increasing <i>Kp</i> means that we will no longer achieve the minimum possible performance metric, however, we are willing to do that in order
         to decrease the resulting settle time. Specifically, we will change <i>Kp</i> so that it equals 2. The resulting PID controller is shown below.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(6)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/html/AircraftPitch_ControlPID_eq90016.png" alt="$$ C(s) = 4.4545 \frac{1 + 0.45s +1.1s^2}{s} \approx \frac{4.45}{s} + 2.00 + 4.90s $$"></p>
      <p>In order to see the effect of this compensator on the closed-loop step response, you need to modify the compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) manually. This can be done under the <b>Compensator Editor</b> tab of the <b>Control and Estimation Tools Manager</b> window. Specifically, the <b>Complex Zero</b> of the compensator needs to be modified so that it has a <b>Real part</b> of -0.2041 and an <b>Imaginary part</b> of 0.9314 corresponding to the numerator of our controller shown above. Once these changes are made, the step response should
         appear as follows.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture10.png" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The response shown above meets all of the given requirements as summarized below.</p>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li>Overshoot = 5% &lt; 10%</li>
            <li>Rise time = 1.2 seconds &lt; 2 seconds</li>
            <li>Settling time = 5 seconds &lt; 10 seconds</li>
            <li>Steady-state error = 0% &lt; 2%</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Therefore, this PID controller will provide the desired performance of the aircraft's pitch.</p>

% performance of our system with this controller, go to the *Analysis
% Plots* tab of the *Control and Estimation Tools Manager* window. Then
% choose a *Plot Type* of |Step| for *Plot 1* in the *Analysis Plots*
% section of the window as shown below. Then choose a response of *Closed
% loop r to y* for *Plot 1* as shown in the figure below.
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture3.png>>
%
% A window will then open with the following step response displayed.
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture4.png>>
%
% Examination of the above shows that aside from steady-state error, the
% given design requirements have not been met. The gain chosen for _Kp_ can
% be adjusted in an attempt to modify the resulting performance through the
% *Compensator Editor* tab. Instead, we will use the *SISO Design Tool* to
% automatically tune our proportional compensator. In order to use this
% feature, go to the *Automated Tuning* tab and choose |PID Tuning| from the
% *Design method* drop-down menu. Then select a *Controller type* of |P| as
% shown in the figure below. 
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture5.png>>
%
% There are a range of options that can be chosen from the *Tuning
% algorithm* drop-down menu. These options range 
% from heuristic techniques, like Ziegler-Nichols, to numerical approaches
% that search over all possible control gains to minimize some identified
% performance index that is usually related to the error _e_(_t_) in the control
% system. As these metrics attempt to minimize the error over time, they
% address both transient requirements such as overshoot and rise time, as well
% as steady-state requirements such as steady-state error. For our example,
% choose |Parameter search| from the *Tuning algorithm* menu. Then choose
% |Integral Time Square Error (ITSE)| as the *Performance metric*. This
% approach will search over a range of proportional gains to find one that
% minimizes the following metric.
%
% $$ ITSE = \int_0^T te(t)^2 dt $$
%
% In order to be useful, a metric must always be greater than zero. This
% can be achieved by taking the absolute value of the error, or by squaring
% the error as is done in this case. An added effect of taking the square
% of the error is that large errors are penalized more heavily than small
% errors. The ITSE metric also multiplies the squared error by the time _t_. The
% effect of this is to minimize the contribution of a large initial error
% due to the step reference.
%
% Once all of the tuning settings have been chosen, you then click the
% *Update Compensator* button. This algorithm found that a proportional
% gain of _Kp_ = 0.01854 minimizes the ITSE metric leading to the following
% closed-loop step response.
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture6.png>>
%
% The resulting response is very slow, even slower than our somewhat
% randomly chosen initial gain _Kp_ = 2. This seems to be related to the fact
% that our metric weighs error at larger values of _t_ more heavily.
% Therefore, try changing the *Performance metric* to |Integral Square
% Error (ISE)| and click the *Update Compensator* button again. The gain
% that minimizes this metric is found to be _Kp_ = 1 and the resulting
% closed-loop step response is shown below. 
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture7.png>>
%
% The resulting performance is improved, though the settle time is
% still much too large. We will likely need to add integral and/or
% derivative terms to our controller in order to meet the given
% requirements.
%
%% PI control
% Recalling the information provided in the 
% < ?example=Introduction&section=ControlPID Introduction: PID Controller Design> tutorial 
% integral control is often helpful in reducing steady-state
% error. In our case, the steady-state error requirement is already being
% met. For purposes of illustration, let's design a PI controller anyway.
% We will again use automated tuning to choose our controller gains. Under
% the *Automated Tuning* tab change the *Controller type* to |PI| and leave
% the *Tuning algorithm* as |Parameter search| and the *Performance metric*
% as |Integral Square Error (ISE)|. Clicking on the *Compensator Update* button
% then produces the following controller.
% 
% $$ C(s) = 0.55599\frac{1 + 1.8s}{s} \approx \frac{0.56}{s} + 1.00 $$
%
% This transfer function is a PI compensator with _Ki_ = 0.56 and _Kp_ =
% 1.00. The resulting closed-loop step response is shown below.
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture8.png>>
% 
% From inspection of the above, notice that the addition of integral
% control helped reduce the average error in the signal more quickly.
% Unfortunately, the integral control also made the response more
% oscillatory, therefore, the settle time requirement is still not met.
% Furthermore, the overshoot requirement is no longer met either. Let's try
% also adding a derivative term to our controller.
%% PID Control 
% Again recalling the lessons we have learned in the 
% < ?example=Introduction&section=ControlPID Introduction: PID Controller Design> tutorial 
% increasing the derivative gain _Kd_ in a PID controller can
% often help reduce overshoot. Therefore, by adding derivative control we
% may be able to reduce the oscillation in the response a sufficient amount
% that we can then increase the other gains to reduce the
% settling time.  Let's test our hypothesis by changing the *Controller
% type* to |PID| and again clicking the *Update Compensator* button. The
% generated controller is shown below.
% 
% $$ C(s) = 4.4545 \frac{1 + 0.22s +1.1s^2}{s} \approx \frac{4.45}{s} + 0.98 + 4.90s $$
%
% This transfer function is a PID compensator with _Ki_ = 4.45, _Kp_ =
% 0.98, and _Kd_ = 4.90. The resulting closed-loop step response is shown below.
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture9.png>>
% 
% This response meets all of the requirements except for the settle time
% which at 12.6 seconds is a little larger than the given requirement of 10
% seconds. We will attempt to increase the proportional gain in order to
% reduce the system's settle time. Increasing _Kp_ means that we will no
% longer achieve the minimum possible performance metric, however, we are
% willing to do that in order to decrease the resulting settle time.
% Specifically, we will change _Kp_ so that it equals 2. The resulting PID
% controller is shown below. 
% 
% $$ C(s) = 4.4545 \frac{1 + 0.45s +1.1s^2}{s} \approx \frac{4.45}{s} + 2.00 + 4.90s $$
%
% In order to see the effect of this compensator on the closed-loop step
% response, you need to modify the compensator _C_(_s_) manually. This can be
% done under the *Compensator Editor* tab of the *Control and Estimation
% Tools Manager* window. Specifically, the *Complex Zero* of the
% compensator needs to be modified so that it has a *Real part* of -0.2041
% and an *Imaginary part* of 0.9314 corresponding to the numerator of our
% controller shown above. Once these changes are made, the step 
% response should appear as follows. 
%
% <<Content/AircraftPitch/Control/PID/figures/Picture10.png>>
% 
% The response shown above meets all of the given requirements as
% summarized below.
%
% * Overshoot = 5% < 10%
% * Rise time = 1.2 seconds < 2 seconds
% * Settling time = 5 seconds < 10 seconds
% * Steady-state error = 0% < 2%
%
% Therefore, this PID controller will provide the desired performance of
% the aircraft's pitch.
