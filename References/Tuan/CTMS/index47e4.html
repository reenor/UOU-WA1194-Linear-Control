      <p>Lead and lag compensators are used quite extensively in control. A lead compensator can increase the stability or speed of
         reponse of a system; a lag compensator can reduce (but not eliminate) the steady-state error. Depending on the effect desired,
         one or more lead and lag compensators may be used in various combinations.
      </p>
      <p>Lead, lag, and lead/lag compensators are usually designed for a system in transfer function form. The <a href="index3f2a.html?aux=Extras_Conversions">conversions</a> page explains how to convert a state-space model into transfer function form.
      </p>
      <h2>Lead or phase-lead compensator using root locus<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>A first-order lead compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) can be designed using the root locus. A lead compensator in root locus form is given by
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(1)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq83223.png" alt="$$ C(s)=K_{c}\frac{(s-z_{0})}{(s-p_{0})} $$"></p>
      <p>where the magnitude of <i>z0</i> is less than the magnitude of <i>p0</i>. A phase-lead compensator tends to shift the root locus toward to the left in the complex <i>s</i>-plane. This results in an improvement in the system's stability and an increase in its response speed.
      </p>
      <p>How is this accomplished? If you recall finding the asymptotes of the root locus that lead to the zeros at infinity, the equation
         to determine the intersection of the asymptotes along the real axis is the following.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(2)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq13075.png" alt="$$ a=\frac{\sum(poles)-\sum(zeros)}{(\#poles)-(\#zeros)} $$"></p>
      <p>When a lead compensator is added to a system, the value of this intersection will be a larger negative number than it was
         before. The net number of zeros and poles will be same (one zero and one pole are added), but the added pole is a larger negative
         number than the added zero. Thus, the result of a lead compensator is that the asymptotes' intersection is moved further to
         the left in the complex plane, and the entire root locus is shifted to the left as well. This tends to increase the region
         of stability and the system's response speed.
      </p>
      <p>In MATLAB a phase-lead compensator in root locus form is implemented using the following commands (where <tt>Kc</tt>, <tt>z</tt>, and <tt>p</tt> are defined).
      </p>
      <p>
         <pre class="codeinput">
         s = tf('s');
         C_lead = Kc*(s-z)/(s-p);
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <p>We can interconnect this compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) with a plant <i>P</i>(<i>s</i>) using the following code.
      </p>
      <p>
         <pre class="codeinput">
         sys_ol = C_lead*P;
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <h2>Lead or phase-lead compensator using frequency response<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>A first-order phase-lead compensator can also be designed using a frequency reponse approach. A lead compensator in frequency
         response form is given by the following.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(3)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq36669.png" alt="$$ C(s) = \frac{1+aTs}{1+Ts} \qquad [ a&gt;1 ] $$"></p>
      <p>Note that this is equivalent to the root locus form repeated below</p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(4)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq83223.png" alt="$$ C(s)=K_{c}\frac{(s-z_{0})}{(s-p_{0})} $$"></p>
      <p>with <i>p</i> =1 / <i>T</i>, <i>z</i> = 1 / <i>aT</i>, and <i>Kc</i> = <i>a</i>. In frequency response design, the phase-lead compensator adds positive phase to the system over the frequency range 1 /
         <i>aT</i> to 1 / <i>T</i>. A Bode plot of a phase-lead compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) has the following form.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/lead1.gif" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The two corner frequencies are at 1 / <i>aT</i> and  1 / <i>T</i>; note the positive phase that is added to the system between these two frequencies. Depending on the value of <i>a</i>, the maximum added phase can be up to 90 degrees; if you need more than 90 degrees of phase, two lead compensators in series
         can be employed. The maximum amount of phase is added at the center frequency, which is calculated according to the following
         equation.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(5)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq90862.png" alt="$$\omega_{m}=\frac{1}{T\sqrt{a}}$$"></p>
      <p>The equation which determines the maximum phase is given below.</p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(6)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq61456.png" alt="$$\sin\phi=\frac{a-1}{a+1}$$"></p>
      <p>Additional positive phase increases the phase margin and thus increases the stability of the system. This type of compensator
         is designed by determining <i>a</i> from the amount of phase needed to satisfy the phase margin requirements, and determing <i>T</i> to place the added phase at the new gain-crossover frequency.
      </p>
      <p>Another effect of the lead compensator can be seen in the magnitude plot. The lead compensator increases the gain of the system
         at high frequencies (the amount of this gain is equal to <i>a</i>). This can increase the crossover frequency, which will help to decrease the rise time and settling time of the system (but
         may amplify high frequency noise).
      </p>
      <p>In MATLAB, a phase-lead compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) in frequency response form is implemented using the following code (where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>T</tt> are defined).
      </p>
      <p>
         <pre class="codeinput">
         s = tf('s');
         C_lead = (1+a*T*s)/(1+T*s);
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <p>We can then interconnect it with a plant <i>P</i>(<i>s</i>) using the following code.
      </p>
      <p>
         <pre class="codeinput">
         sys_ol = C_lead*P;
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <h2>Lag or phase-lag compensator using root locus<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>A first-order lag compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) can be designed using the root locus. A lag compensator in root locus form is given by the following.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(7)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq16927.png" alt="$$ C(s) = \frac{(s-z_{0})}{(s-p_{0})} $$"></p>
      <p>This has a similar form to a lead compensator, except now the magnitude of <i>z0</i> is greater than the magnitude of <i>p0</i> (and the additional gain <i>Kc</i> is omitted). A phase-lag compensator tends to shift the root locus to the right in the complex <i>s</i>-plane, which is undesirable. For this reason, the pole and zero of a lag compensator are often placed close together (usually
         near the origin) so that they do not appreciably change the transient response or stability characteristics of the system.
      </p>
      <p>How does the lag controller shift the root locus to the right? Below is repeated the equation for finding where the asymptotes
         of the root locus intersect along the real axis.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(8)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq00636.png" alt="$$ a=\frac{\sum(poles)-\sum(zeros)}{(\#poles)-(\#zeros)}$$"></p>
      <p>When a lag compensator is added to a system, the value of this intersection will be a smaller negative number than it was
         before. The net number of zeros and poles will be the same (one zero and one pole are added), but the added pole is a smaller
         negative number than the added zero. Thus, the result of a lag compensator is that the asymptotes' intersection is moved to
         the right in the complex plane, and the entire root locus is shifted to the right as well.
      </p>
      <p>It was previously stated that a lag compensator is often designed to minimally change the transient response of system because
         it generally has a negative effect. If the phase-lag compensator is not supposed to change the transient response noticeably,
         what is it good for then? The answer is that a phase-lag compensator can improve the system's steady-state response. It works
         in the following manner. At high frequencies, the lag compensator will have unity gain. At low frequencies, the gain will
         be <i>z0</i> / <i>p0</i> which is greater than 1. This <i>z0</i> / <i>p0</i> factor will multiply the position, velocity, or acceleration constant (<i>Kp</i>, <i>Kv</i>, or <i>Ka</i>), and the <a href="index1b88.html?aux=Extras_Ess">steady-state error</a> will thus decrease by the same factor.
      </p>
      <p>In MATLAB, a phase-lag compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) in root locus form is implemented by employing the following code where it is again assumed that <tt>z</tt> and <tt>p</tt> are previously defined.
      </p>
      <p>
         <pre class="codeinput">
         s = tf('s');
         C_lag = (s-z)/(s-p);
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <p>We can also interconnect the compensator with a plant <i>P</i>(<i>s</i>) as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
         <pre class="codeinput">
         sys_ol = C_lag*P;
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <h2>Lag or phase-lag compensator using frequency response<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>A first-order phase-lag compensator also can be designed using a frequency response approach. A lag compensator in frequency
         response form is given by the following.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(9)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq48430.png" alt="$$C(s)=\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{1+aTs}{1+Ts}\right) \qquad [ a<1 ]$$"></p>
      <p>The phase-lag compensator looks similar to phase-lead compensator, except that <i>a</i> is now less than 1. The main difference is that the lag compensator adds negative phase to the system over the specified
         frequency range, while a lead compensator adds positive phase over the specified frequency. A Bode plot of a phase-lag compensator
         has the following form.
      </p>
      <p><img class="figure"vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Content/Extras/figures/lag2.gif" alt=""> </p>
      <p>The two corner frequencies are at 1 / <i>T</i> and  1 / <i>aT</i>. The main effect of the lag compensator is shown in the magnitude plot. The lag compensator adds gain at low frequencies;
         the magnitude of this gain is equal to <i>a</i>. The effect of this gain is to cause the  <a href="index1b88.html?aux=Extras_Ess">steady-state error</a> of the closed-loop system to be decreased by a factor of <i>a</i>. Because the gain of the lag compensator is unity at middle and high frequencies, the transient response and stability are
         generally not impacted much.
      </p>
      <p>The side effect of the lag compensator is the negative phase that is added to the system between the two corner frequencies.
         Depending on the value <i>a</i>, up to -90 degrees of phase can be added. Care must be taken that the phase margin of the system with lag compensation is
         still satisfactory. This is generally achieved by placing the frequency of maximum phase lag, <i>wm</i> as calculated below, well below the new gain crossover frequency.
      </p>
      <p><span class="eqn_num">(10)</span><img class="display_eqn" src="Content/Extras/html/Extras_Leadlag_eq90862.png" alt="$$\omega_{m}=\frac{1}{T\sqrt{a}}$$"></p>
      <p>In MATLAB, a phase-lag compensator <i>C</i>(<i>s</i>) in frequency response form is implemented using the following code, again assuming that <tt>a</tt> and <tt>T</tt> are defined.
      </p>
      <p>
         <pre class="codeinput">

         C_lag = (a*T*s+1)/(a*(T*s+1));
         </pre>
         
      </p>
      <p>We can again interconnect the compensator with a plant <i>P</i>(<i>s</i>) as follows.

      <h2>Lead-lag compensator using either root locus or frequency response<a name="12"></a></h2>
      <p>A lead-lag compensator combines the effects of a lead compensator with those of a lag compensator. The result is a system
         with improved transient response, stability, and steady-state error. To implement a lead-lag compensator, first design the
         lead compensator to achieve the desired transient response and stability, and then design a lag compensator to improve the
         steady-state response of the lead-compensated system.

% The maximum amount of phase is added at the center frequency, which is
% calculated according to the following equation.
%
% $$\omega_{m}=\frac{1}{T\sqrt{a}}$$
%
% The equation which determines the maximum phase is given below.
%
% $$\sin\phi=\frac{a-1}{a+1}$$
%
% Additional positive phase increases the phase margin and thus increases
% the stability of the system. This type of compensator is designed by
% determining _a_ from the amount of phase needed to satisfy the phase
% margin requirements, and determing _T_ to place the added phase at the new
% gain-crossover frequency.
%
% Another effect of the lead compensator can be seen in the magnitude plot.
% The lead compensator increases the gain of the system at high frequencies
% (the amount of this gain is equal to _a_). This can increase the crossover
% frequency, which will help to decrease the rise time and settling time of
% the system (but may amplify high frequency noise).
%
% In MATLAB, a phase-lead compensator _C_(_s_) in frequency response form is
% implemented using the following code (where |a| and |T| are defined). 
%
% <html>
% <pre class="codeinput">
% s = tf('s');
% C_lead = (1+a*T*s)/(1+T*s);
% </pre>
% </html>
%
%% 
% We can then interconnect it with a plant _P_(_s_) using the following
% code.
%
% <html>
% <pre class="codeinput">
% sys_ol = C_lead*P;
% </pre>
% </html>
%
%% Lag or phase-lag compensator using root locus
% A first-order lag compensator _C_(_s_) can be designed using the root locus. A lag
% compensator in root locus form is given by the following.
%
% $$ C(s) = \frac{(s-z_{0})}{(s-p_{0})} $$
%
% This has a similar form to a lead compensator, except now the magnitude of
% _z0_ is greater than the magnitude of _p0_ (and the additional gain _Kc_
% is omitted). A   
% phase-lag compensator tends to shift the root locus to the right in the
% complex _s_-plane, which is undesirable. For this reason, the pole and
% zero of a lag compensator are often placed close together (usually near the
% origin) so that they do not appreciably change the transient response or
% stability characteristics of the system.
%
% How does the lag controller shift the root locus to the right? Below is
% repeated the equation for finding where the asymptotes of the root locus
% intersect along the real axis.
%
% $$ a=\frac{\sum(poles)-\sum(zeros)}{(\#poles)-(\#zeros)}$$
%
% When a lag compensator is added to a system, the value of this
% intersection will be a smaller negative number than it was before. The
% net number of zeros and poles will be the same (one zero and one pole are
% added), but the added pole is a smaller negative number than the added
% zero. Thus, the result of a lag compensator is that the asymptotes'
% intersection is moved to the right in the complex plane, and the entire root
% locus is shifted to the right as well.
%
% It was previously stated that a lag compensator is often designed to
% minimally change the transient response of system because it generally
% has a negative effect. If the phase-lag compensator is not supposed to
% change the transient response noticeably, what is it good for then? The
% answer is that a phase-lag compensator can improve the system's
% steady-state response. It works in the following manner. At high
% frequencies, the lag compensator will have unity gain. At low frequencies,
% the gain will be _z0_ / _p0_ which is greater  
% than 1. This _z0_ / _p0_ factor will multiply the position, velocity, or 
% acceleration constant (_Kp_, _Kv_, or _Ka_), and the
% < ?aux=Extras_Ess steady-state error> will thus decrease by the
% same factor.  
%
% In MATLAB, a phase-lag compensator _C_(_s_) in root locus form is implemented by
% employing the following code where it is again assumed that |z| and |p| are previously defined. 
%
% <html>
% <pre class="codeinput">
% s = tf('s');
% C_lag = (s-z)/(s-p);
% </pre>
% </html>
%
%%
% We can also interconnect the compensator with a plant _P_(_s_) as
% follows.
%
% <html>
% <pre class="codeinput">
% sys_ol = C_lag*P;
% </pre>
% </html>
%
%% Lag or phase-lag compensator using frequency response
% A first-order phase-lag compensator also can be designed using a frequency
% response approach. A lag compensator in frequency response form is given
% by the following.
%
% $$C(s)=\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{1+aTs}{1+Ts}\right) \qquad [ a<1 ]$$
%
% The phase-lag compensator looks similar to phase-lead compensator, except
% that _a_ is now less than 1. The main difference is that the lag
% compensator adds negative phase to the system over the specified
% frequency range, while a lead compensator adds positive phase over the
% specified frequency. A Bode plot of a phase-lag compensator has the
% following form.
%
% <<Content/Extras/figures/lag2.gif>>
%
% The two corner frequencies are at 1 / _T_ and  1 / _aT_. The main effect of the
% lag compensator is shown in the magnitude plot. The lag compensator adds
% gain at low frequencies; the magnitude of this gain is equal to _a_. The
% effect of this gain is to cause the  < ?aux=Extras_Ess
% steady-state error> of the closed-loop system to be decreased by a factor 
% of _a_. Because the gain of the lag compensator is unity at middle and
% high frequencies, the transient response and stability are generally not
% impacted much.
%
% The side effect of the lag compensator is the negative phase that is
% added to the system between the two corner frequencies. Depending on the
% value _a_, up to -90 degrees of phase can be added. Care must be taken
% that the phase margin of the system with lag compensation is still
% satisfactory. This is generally achieved by placing the frequency of
% maximum phase lag, _wm_ as calculated below, well below the
% new gain crossover frequency.
%
% $$\omega_{m}=\frac{1}{T\sqrt{a}}$$
%
% In MATLAB, a phase-lag compensator _C_(_s_) in frequency response form is
% implemented using the following code, again assuming that |a| and |T| are
% defined. 
%
% <html>
% <pre class="codeinput">
% s = tf('s');
% C_lag = (a*T*s+1)/(a*(T*s+1));
% </pre>
% </html>
%
%% 
% We can again interconnect the compensator with a plant _P_(_s_) as
% follows.
%
% <html>
% <pre class="codeinput">
% sys_ol = C_lag*P;
% </pre>
% </html>
%
%% Lead-lag compensator using either root locus or frequency response
% A lead-lag compensator combines the effects of a lead compensator with
% those of a lag compensator. The result is a system with improved
% transient response, stability, and steady-state error. To implement a
% lead-lag compensator, first design the lead compensator to achieve the
% desired transient response and stability, and then design a lag
% compensator to improve the steady-state response of the lead-compensated
% system.
